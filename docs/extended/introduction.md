.. note:: BandSOS Project
    Experimented on the Bengal delta in Bangladesh, BanD-SOS project aims to establish a pre-operational service for forecasting 
    cyclonic flooding and the associated societal risk. This service will have two components: a forecast of the coastal 
    flooding hazard in real time that uses a state-of-the-art coupled hydrodynamic-wave modelling platform, and a coupling 
    of this forecast with a mapping of the vulnerability of the exposed areas. The project is a collaboration with Bangladesh
    Water Development Board (BWDB) - the government engineering organization of Bangladesh which manages the water resource
    infrastructure and tasked with providing the flood forecasting to the vast community of Bangladesh.
